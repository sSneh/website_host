                                    This project was originally meant to be a portfolio website but was changed to a
                                    hotel website redesign after approval. The original website (which is hosted at
                                    theashwood.com) was created using squarespace website maker by the hotel owner and
                                    has a myriad of problems. Some of which are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        - It is too complicated for users to find the information that they need</li>
                                    <li>
                                        - It lacks direction and purpose</li>
                                    <li>
                                        - The website design and the booking portal (managed by another company) have
                                        completely different designs and are often an area where customers hesitate to
                                        book
                                        as they think the site is sketchy and unreliable (this has been a common
                                        complaint)</li>
                                    <li>
                                        - The "Book Now" button is only available on one page of the website and it is
                                        not
                                        even at the top, users need to scroll down to find it</li>
                                    <li>
                                        - Too many site pages that have no meaningful purpose and because of this lack
                                        of
                                        organization there are many broken links</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="card-text lh-lg">
                                    This project aimed to fix most of these problems and while most were acknowledged,
                                    due to time restraints or project requirements, not all problems have been fixed as
                                    best as they could be. The new site was given a fresh look that is based on this
                                    Behance mockup : https://www.behance.net/gallery/130697071/The-Clarke-House-Inn
                                    This is a mockup that I really like and pulled heavy inspiration from (basically
                                    used it as a reference website for the homepage). While the layout, colour theme,
                                    and certain phrases were reused, all code was done from scratch and nothing in the
                                    code (other than those tagged), was taken from other sources.<br><br>

                                    I aimed for the website to make the booking process as painless as possible which
                                    was accomplished through a consistent header that is reused throughout the website
                                    and has two areas where the booking portal can be reached. However, the booking
                                    portal itself was not modified in the version of the website as it is not hosted by
                                    the hotel and I have no access to its API/backend. This is a future problem. Pages
                                    like the 'Blog', 'Intro', 'The Ashwood', etc. were either removed, renamed, or
                                    merged with another heading. This was because these pages provided nothing for the
                                    user, was poorly named, and didn't encourage the user to book a room (which is
                                    ultimately the goal of this website).<br><br>

                                    To satisfy the requirements of the assignment (aside from the home page and process
                                    plan) the page named 'Rooms' incorporates tabular content using Bootstraps Pills to
                                    shuffle through the 4 different room types. The 'Gallery' Page is self-explanatory
                                    and uses Bootstrap Carousel to display 6 different images, all of which were taken
                                    from the original site. The 'Contact Us' Page satisfies the form page requirement
                                    and incorporates a few input text boxes. And finally, the 'Process Plan' page
                                    satisfies the Content Heavy page as it is entirely text-dominated.<br><br>
